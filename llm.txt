ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Here’s the modified code to create a graph similar to the one you want. This version follows the structure of your new graph while incorporating elements from the previous one:

r
Copy code
data_cleaned %>%
  select(location_type, occurrence_year) %>%
  group_by(occurrence_year, location_type) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Count = n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = occurrence_year, y = Count, color = location_type), size = 2) +
  scale_color_poke(pokemon = 'Charizard', spread = NULL) + 
  theme_light() + 
  labs(x = "Year Offence Occured", 
       y = "Number of Observations", 
       title = "Distribution of Offences by Location Type Over Time") + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size=3))) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2018, 2023, by = 1))
Key Changes:
Grouping by occurrence_year and location_type: This ensures the data is summarized by year and location.
Summarization with n(): Counts the number of observations for each location_type per year.
Plotting with geom_point(): Plots the number of observations (Count) against occurrence_year, with colors representing different location_type.
Added theme and title elements: The plot title and visual tweaks are similar to the style in your first example.

how to change the color
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
To change the color of the points in your graph, you can replace the scale_color_poke() function with a custom color scale such as scale_color_manual(), scale_color_brewer(), or scale_color_viridis(), depending on your preference. Here are a few examples of how to do this:

1. Using scale_color_manual():
This allows you to specify your own colors for each category.

r
Copy code
data_cleaned %>%
  select(location_type, occurrence_year) %>%
  group_by(occurrence_year, location_type) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Count = n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = occurrence_year, y = Count, color = location_type), size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "blue", "green", "orange")) + 
  theme_light() + 
  labs(x = "Year Offence Occured", 
       y = "Number of Observations", 
       title = "Distribution of Offences by Location Type Over Time") + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size=3))) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2018, 2023, by = 1))
2. Using scale_color_brewer():
This function applies a pre-made palette from the ColorBrewer collection.

r
Copy code
data_cleaned %>%
  select(location_type, occurrence_year) %>%
  group_by(occurrence_year, location_type) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Count = n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = occurrence_year, y = Count, color = location_type), size = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +  # Change "Set2" to other palettes like "Dark2", "Paired", etc.
  theme_light() + 
  labs(x = "Year Offence Occured", 
       y = "Number of Observations", 
       title = "Distribution of Offences by Location Type Over Time") + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size=3))) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2018, 2023, by = 1))
3. Using scale_color_viridis():
If you prefer colorblind-friendly palettes, viridis provides a good option.

r
Copy code
library(viridis)

data_cleaned %>%
  select(location_type, occurrence_year) %>%
  group_by(occurrence_year, location_type) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Count = n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = occurrence_year, y = Count, color = location_type), size = 2) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) + 
  theme_light() + 
  labs(x = "Year Offence Occured", 
       y = "Number of Observations", 
       title = "Distribution of Offences by Location Type Over Time") + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size=3))) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2018, 2023, by = 1))
Summary:
scale_color_manual(): Manually set your colors.
scale_color_brewer(): Choose from ColorBrewer palettes.
scale_color_viridis(): Colorblind-friendly palette.
Pick the one that best fits your preferences!

correct grammar mistakes, make my writing natural and smooth if needed: The issue of hate crimes is a global concern. Hate crimes are typically defined as criminal offences committed against a person or property based solely on the victim’s identity, such as race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender, or disability [@justice]. These crimes not only harm the individual victims but also create an atmosphere of fear and division within society. As one of the most diverse cities in the world, Toronto is experiencing a rising number of hate crimes, which has raised significant public concern. This trend highlights the urgent need for effective interventions that can address the root causes of such crimes. To better allocate resources and reduce hate, it is important to analyze hate crimes data—specifically, whether criminals are targeting particular groups and, if so, which ones.

This paper utilizes data from Open Data Toronto to explore the distribution of hate crimes by bias and location from 2018 to 2023. The biases examined include race, religion, and mental or physical disability. The locations considered are various regions in Toronto and different types of settings where the crimes occur. The results show that a significant proportion of hate crimes were directed at Black individuals and Jewish people, accounting for approximately 16% and 31% of incidents, respectively. About half of the crimes occurred in public spaces or transportation and about half were property crimes, with increasing trends observed in educational and commercial/business settings. 

The structure of this paper is as follows: The data utilized for analysis is introduced in @sec-data. Following that, @sec-results presents visualizations and analysis of the data. @sec-discussion then discusses the findings in a broader context, addresses limitations and outlines potential next steps. This analysis is conducted using the programming language R [@r] and the following packages: opendatatoronto [@ropendatatoronto], dplyr [@rdplyr], tidyverse [@rtidyverse], here [@rhere], janitor [@rjanitor], knitr [@rknitr], ggplot2 [@rggplot2].

# Data {#sec-data}
## Data Overview and Measurement
A hate crime is a criminal offence committed against a person motivated by bias and prejudice [@hatecrime]. This analysis uses the Hate Crimes Open Data downloaded from Open Data Toronto to analyze the bias behind hate crimes and the location of offence. It contains all verified hate crime occurrences from 2018 to 2023, with annual updates. The dataset categorizes crimes based on age, mental or physical disability, race, ethnicity, language, religion, sexual orientation, and gender.

The variables or measurements included in the dataset are ID, occurrence time (time, date and year), reported time (time, date and year), police division, location type, and various bias categories (age, disability, race, ethnicity, language, religion, sexual orientation, and gender), the primary offence related to the hate crime, neighbourhood, and arrest status. I also created two new variables: occurrence month, derived from the occurrence date, and division area, which groups the 16 police divisions and NSA into 5 regions of Toronto, with an additional ‘Other’ category.

The raw dataset contains 1350 hate crimes. After cleaning the data, 1287 rows remain. This analysis mainly focuses on biases related to disability, race, and religion, as well as the time and location of hate crimes. 

## Data Cleaning
Missing values are removed from the dataset. A new column for the occurrence month is created by extracting the month from the occurrence_date. 

The religion_bias column is cleaned by consolidating various Christian denominations into a single ‘Christian’ category, while mixed biases were excluded. Similarly, the unclear values in the race_bias column, such as ‘Black, South Asian’, was removed. The location_type column was regrouped to simplify the categorization. A new column primary_offence_simplified was created to group primary offenses into major categories like ‘Assault’ and ‘Property Crimes’. Finally, the dataset was modified to include a simplified division_area column based on police divisions.

As shown in @fig-location_year, the most common location type for hate crimes is public spaces/transportation, followed by educational and residential areas. A sudden increase of crimes in public spaces/transportation took place in 2020, remaining high until 2023. Starting from 2021, the number of hate crimes in educational settings increased. Crimes in commercial/business buildings, as well as government buildings, rose in 2023.

Hate crimes in Toronto involving race and religion biases are often influenced by global and local events. The rise in hate crimes against East and Southeast Asian communities during 2020 and 2021 could be attributed to the outbreak of COVID-19. As the pandemic spread, harmful stereotypes and misinformation may lead to xenophobia and hate. This resulted in a surge of racially motivated hate crimes, reflecting a pattern of pandemic-related discrimination seen in many places around the world. The return to normal life in 2022 and 2023 could be a large reason contributed to the reduction in hate incidents. Similarly, the sharp rise in hate crimes against Black individuals from 2019 to 2020 coincides with heightened racial tensions and movements like Black Lives Matter, which gained global attention after incidents of police brutality. 
The significant increase in hate crimes targeting Jewish communities in 2023 appears to be tied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There were numerous parades and protests in Toronto last year. As attention on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict increased, it is likely that some individuals committed hate crimes against Jewish people in response. The increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2023 could be related to similar international dynamics or to ongoing Islamophobia that has been exacerbated by media portrayal of global events. In 2020, some controversies involving the Catholic Church, such as discussions around clerical abuse scandals or abortion, could have intensified negative sentiments toward Catholics, causing an increasing number of hate crimes towards this community.

## Regions and Locations
The prevalence of hate crimes in public spaces and transportation can be attributed to several factors. First, these areas are easily accessible and often crowded, allowing individuals to commit crimes with less fear of being identified. Second, the crowded environment makes it easier to carry out random acts of violence, such as pushing someone onto a subway track. The rise in hate crimes in residential and educational settings in 2022 and 2023 may be linked to the economic and social pressures experienced after the pandemic.
The Toronto-East York region, with its large population, naturally has a higher number of hate crimes, particularly in public and commercial locations. The presence of numerous commercial buildings and public transportation options contributes to this trend. The prevalence of residential crimes in North York and Etobicoke-York may also be due to the significant number of residential constructions in these regions. Since assaults are easier to commit in public spaces rather than private areas, it makes sense that property crimes are the most common offences across all locations, except for public spaces and transportation, where assaults are more frequent. Furthermore, the fact that most hate crimes are property crimes can be linked to the observation that more than half of these incidents are not motivated by bias, as stealing from anyone is essentially the same. 

## Limitation
This dataset only includes confirmed hate crimes and does not account for occurrences deemed unfounded or classified as hate incidents. Additionally, some hate crimes may go unreported due to victim fear or distrust in law enforcement, causing potential biases. For instance, crimes that occur in households might be underrepresented, as victims may feel more vulnerable knowing the perpetrator has access to their home address, unlike crimes committed in public spaces. Furthermore, the dataset, covering only the years from 2018 to 2023, may overlook long-term trends and patterns in hate crimes.

## Next steps
To effectively reduce hate crimes, it would be beneficial to collect data on the motivations behind these incidents. Understanding the differences between property crimes and those explicitly targeting individuals based on bias could provide valuable insights. 

While most victims report hate crimes within a day, some do not report until ten days later,. Future research could focus on the reasons behind delayed reporting and the factors contributing to victim fear. Collaborating with local organizations and advocacy groups could enhance support for affected communities and help develop targeted prevention strategies.

To make the graph smaller when rendered to a PDF, you can adjust the fig.width and fig.height options in your code chunk. These options control the width and height of the figure in inches.

Here’s how you can modify your code to make the graph smaller:

{r
Copy code
data_cleaned |>
  group_by(occurrence_month) |>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = occurrence_month, y = n)) +
  geom_line(color = "tomato4") +
  geom_point(color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Occurrence Month", y = "Number of Observations") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12) +  # Set x-axis breaks to show only 1 to 12
  theme_minimal()
In this example:

fig.width=5: sets the width of the figure to 5 inches.
fig.height=4: sets the height of the figure to 4 inches.
You can adjust these values based on how small or large you want the graph to be.






You said:
where did you set width and height
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
I set the width and height in the code chunk options, specifically in the fig.width and fig.height parameters within the curly braces {r ...}. These parameters control the size of the plot when rendered to PDF. Here's where they are:

r
Copy code
```{r fig-month, fig.cap="Monthly Occurrences of Hate Crimes in Toronto From 2018 to 2023", fig.width=5, fig.height=4, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Code for generating the graph goes here
markdown
Copy code

- `fig.width=5`: This sets the width of the figure to 5 inches.
- `fig.height=4`: This sets the height of the figure to 4 inches.

These options are placed right after the `r` in the curly braces, where you can also set other options like `message`, `echo`, and `warning`. By changing `fig.width` and `fig.height`, you control the size of the plot in the rendered PDF.

  labs(x = "Occurrence Month", y = "Number of Observations") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12) +  # Set x-axis breaks to show only 1 to 12
  theme_minimal()
In this version:

fig-width: 5: sets the width of the figure to 5 inches.
fig-height: 4: sets the height of the figure to 4 inches.
These options should make the graph smaller in the rendered PDF.
